The purpose of this recipe - is the creation of the database server Oracle, 
ATG Webcommerce servers, Jenkins CI server, Samba server and mailing service.

In folder chef-commerce-new you should run execute_recipe.bat file.

1. First you will be asked to create virtual machines instances.
   You should type Y/y or N/n. If you type y, then VMmanager will 
   create two instances of virual machines with names - ATG and ORACLE.
   Notice, that you may use one machine from them for this recipe.
   
2. Next step - is make choise if you want import public key to the virtual hosts.
   It is desirable, if the machines is new. If yes - type i, else s.
   Now you must know ip addresses of machines (ipconfig).
   It is essential to have a folder .ssh in the home
   directory of the user on the master host(mkdir .ssh)
   In command prompt type appropriate ip. After this enter 
   password which is - "reverse" once or twice.
   
3. The third step - the immediate launch of a prescription (you can guess where).
   You must answer the questions provided, and begin execution of the recipe. 
   It will take some time. After completing the recipe, you will be offered a choice -
   to run or not instances of production and publishing servers. 
   Type y or n (not by defailt).  

4. After finish recipe execution you will have two network drives 
   attached (for atg and jboss folders on virtual machine).
   On jboss disk in folder jenkins_stuff is present jenkins artifacts
   (ATGpublishing.ear, ATGproduction.ear). You cat read and copy them,
   but not write.   
  
   
5. port for ATGpublishing server - 8180
   port for ATGproduction server - 8080
   port for Jenkins - 10000
   port for oraclexe - 1521
   port for OracleWebAdmin -7070
   password for Oracle DB - qazqaz



   !!! To automatically determine the ip address uncomment all the lines in a file createvm.sh

execute_recipe.bat


 When you run a file execute_recipe.bat it invokes createvm.sh file, which starts the process
of creating virtual machines. Then createvm.sh file call file import_keys.sh,
whose task is to establish, if necessary, public keys and import them to the remote machine
for passwordless access. After this process returns to execute_recipe.bat.
    Next in execute_recipe.bat called run_recipe.sh. It interactively collect information from user,
handle this information for chef (creates node file in node directory) and copy all necessary 
distros to the remote host with help of copy_files.sh. Thereafter deploy.sh checks whether the 
remote host has installed chef-solo, and if not, copy there installpackage for chef. Then it
copies cookbooks and file install.sh to the remote host, and transfers control for install.sh.
Install.sh start chef-solo.
   At the end, in a file execute_recipe.bat are connecting network drives on the local machine
